# Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It contains a 
minimal React application with the [MapBox GL JS library](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/) installed.

## Prerequisites

The following must be installed to run the frontend:

* Node >= 16

It's also recommended you start the backend server before running the frontend. See the backend README for more details.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, install the dependencies:

### `yarn install`

Then:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

A [proxy](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) has been defined in `package.json`
that will automatically redirect all requests to the backend server running on port 8000. 

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
